The function has the following specifications:
  
> consumes a string which is the password to be scored
    > returns an integer between 0 to 3 inclusive
    > if the password has a length of fewer than 8 characters, the function always returns 0
    > the returned score is the number of rules that a password is found to pass:
        > has 8 or more characters
        > no character is repeated more than 3 times in a row
        > contains at least one number


To execute the code using Command Prompt (CMD), follow these steps:

1. Open Command Prompt:
   - On Windows, press **Win + R**, type "cmd", and press **Enter**.
   - On macOS, open the **Terminal** application.
   - On Linux, open any terminal emulator application.

2. Navigate to the directory where the Python script is saved:
   - Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example, if the script is saved in the "Documents" folder, you can use the command `cd Documents` to navigate to that directory.

3. Once you are in the correct directory, execute the Python script:
   - Type `python` followed by the script name. For example, if the script is named "password_checker.py", the command will be `python password_checker.py`.
   - Press **Enter** to run the command.

4. The script will prompt you to enter a password. Type your desired password and press **Enter**.

5. The script will evaluate the password and display the password strength score.

Note: Make sure you have Python installed on your system and added to the system's PATH environment variable for the `python` command to be recognized.
